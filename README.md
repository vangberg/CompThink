# CompThink

These are my notes for the [Introduction to Computational Thinking](https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/Spring21/) course.

One of my reasons to follow this course, is to explore [Pluto](https://plutojl.org/),
which I think has some interesting ideas. I will create [issues](https://github.com/vangberg/CompThink/issues)
as I work my way through the course, with thoughts and ideas on how Pluto works,
and how it might be improved.
